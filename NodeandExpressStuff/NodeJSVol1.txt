    Now to use npm:
1:go to the dir where your js file is and type in cmd"npm init" this will initialise npm to be able to use it....
2:they are going to ask you what to name the package, you can name it whatever you want
3:they ask about description, u can type whatever the heck u want and u can ignore the test command and git repositery if u want, and u can type ur author name
4:byes2alouk ekhir shi is this ok, type"yes"

NOTE: "npm init -y" // will initialise the npm with default settings, ma daroure yaane tdal tekbos enter w ekhir shi thot yes

5: this whole process will create a packagge.json file in your directory, having all descriptions of your npm packages so far, once u install external packages they will show up in that file :D
        **********************************************

6:Head over "npmjs.com" to get external npm packages for your project

7: after chosing an npm package, you need to install it byt seeing the command in the documentation and typing it in the cmd in the dir where your project is

//I am doing the superheroes npm example as my first

8: after installing it through the cmd, it will appear in the package.json file in your directory....

9: now you need to type in your js file, the usage which is in the documentation to be able to use it, it is usually a single variable 
ex: const superheroes= require('superheroes');



Note:The basic functionality of require is that it reads a JavaScript file, executes the file, and then proceeds to return the exports object.
     yaane bel step 9, el require function am taamil execuion la hayda el file called superheroes baadena it is exporting kel el functions li      jouweto 3a your file li am teshteghil fi 
....  In other words, shaghlit el require hiye tsewe imports la kel el exports bi hayda el file in parentheses... fa hek bisir fik testaamil el functions w whatever this npm package has.



10: now you can use the npm, see the documentation on how to use it in npm :D
